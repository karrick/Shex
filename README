Shex

The Shex gem provides library functions to perform Shell Execution.
It has some facilities that make executing programs on other hosts and
as other UNIX users quite natural.

require 'rubygems'
require 'Shex'

Shex.shex("find /root", :host => 'somewhere.example.com', :user => 'root')

If the host parameter is provided, and is not the string 'localhost',
and is not the actual name of your host as provided by `hostname -s`,
it will wrap your command with ssh.

If the user parameter is provided, and is not equivalent to your
process's LOGNAME environment variable, it will wrap your command with
sudo.
